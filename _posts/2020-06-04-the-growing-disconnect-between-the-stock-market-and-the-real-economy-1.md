intro_paragraph: As the world continues to struggle with the Covid-19 pandemic,
  the rapid spread of the infection, the mounting death toll and economic
  destruction have brought many countries to the brink of collapse. Yet,
  financial markets worldwide seem to exist in a parallel universe, having
  recovered from the massive losses in March to enter a fresh bull market.

There are no shortage of expert opinions on why this disconnect is occurring.
Some reasons being put forward by market observers for this curious phenomenon include:

### Central Bank Monetary Policies

* As the crisis unfolded, Central Banks around the world responded in a timely manner to support the financial markets and to mitigate the damage to the real economy.

* Central Banks instituted policy rate cuts to reduce the cost of borrowing and to stimulate economic activity.

* Central Banks provided ample liquidity support to the distressed financial markets.

* Central Banks stepped in to purchase financial assets such as government bonds and corporate debt to keep the financial markets functioning.

### Government Fiscal Policies

* Governments around the world have implemented massive fiscal stimulus packages to stem job losses and to mitigate the damage to the real economy.

* Examples of these packages include payroll/job support schemes, soft loans to SMEs, debt moratorium and direct cash handouts.

* Many governments expect to incur substantial budget deficits this year because of these fiscal policies.

### Financial Markets are forward looking

* Financial markets have the uncanny ability to look beyond the present crisis, to anticipate the eventual economic recovery down the road. At this point the Global Stock Markets, rightly or wrongly, are probably pricing in a V-shaped recovery in the real economy.

It is now increasingly clear that the stock market has taken a life of its own and has diverged from current economic realities. The reasons for optimism are justifiable in that the unprecedented Central Bank monetary policies and Government fiscal stimulus packages have so far proven to be effective in mitigating the short-term economic damage from the Covid-19 pandemic.

Markets are also optimistic that the scientific and medical community will eventually develop a viable drug treatment or an effective vaccine for this disease, allowing the resumption of work, business and commercial activities which will lead to the much-needed restoration of Global economic growth.
