intro_paragraph: As the world continues to struggle with the Covid-19 pandemic,
  the rapid spread of the infection, the mounting death toll and economic
  destruction have brought many countries to the brink of collapse. Yet,
  financial markets world wide seem to exist in a parallel universe, having
  recovered from the massive losses in the month of March to enter a new bull
  market.

There are no shortage of expert opinions as to why this disconnect is occurring.
Some of the reasons being put forward by market observers for this curious phenomenon include:

* **Central Bank Monetary Policies**
  * As the crisis unfolded, Central Banks around the world responded in a timely manner to support the financial markets and to mitigate the damage to the real economy.

  * Central Banks instituted policy rate cuts to reduce the cost of borrowing and to stimulate economic activity.

  * Central Banks provided ample liquidity support to the distressed financial markets.

  * Central Banks stepped in to purchase financial assets such as government bonds and corporate debt to keep the financial markets functioning.

* **Government Fiscal Policies**
  * Governments around the world have implemented massive fiscal stimulus packages to stem job losses and to mitigate the damage to the real economy. Examples of these packages include payroll/job support schemes, soft loans to SMEs, debt moratorium and direct cash handouts. Consequently many governments are expected to incur substantial budget deficits this year.

* **Financial Markets are forward looking**
  * Financial markets have the uncanny ability to look beyond the present crisis to anticipate the eventual economic recovery down the road. At this point the Global Stock Markets are probably pricing in a V-shaped recovery in the real economy. Whether this becomes a reality remains to be seen.

It is now increasingly clear that the stock market has taken a life of its own and effectively decoupled from the current economic realities. The reasons for optimism are justifiable in that the unprecedented Central Bank monetary policies and Government fiscal stimulus packages have provided a backstop which effectively mitigates the short term economic damage from the Covd-19 pandemic.

Markets are also optimistic that a viable drug treatment or an effective vaccine will eventually be developed for this disease, thereby allowing the resumption of work, business and commercial activities leading to much needed restoration of Global economic growth.
